## Client SDK

Cobo provides SDKs in five languages - Python, JavaScript, Golang, Java, and PHP - for third-party developers to use.
Developers can easily leverage the SDKs to facilitate development and interact with wallets.
Currently, the SDKs support interactions with web3 wallets and MPC wallets.
