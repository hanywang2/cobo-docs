## Interface Change

Due to the rapid development of the blockchain itself and Cobo Custody's own business, it is difficult for Cobo Custody to ensure that the existing returned fields can fully meet the needs of customers, so Cobo will ensure **forward compatibility** (the old fields cannot be deleted and the meaning will not change), add a new field to the return value,
Access parties need to be compliant with this change.
