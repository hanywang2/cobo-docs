## TSS Node Configuration



You’ll need to complete the following steps on the server where the TSS Node is deployed.



* Copy the callback server’s RSA public key file to the configs directory of the TSS Node

```
cobo-tss-node-generic
├── configs
│   ├── callback-server-pub.key
│   └── cobo-tss-node-config.yaml
```



* Modify the cobo-tss-node-config.yaml file
* cb\_server
* service\_address indicates the callback server address
* pubkey\_path indicates the file path of the callback server’s RSA&#x20;
* token\_expire\_minutes indicates the timeout period of the JWT (unit: minutes)&#x20;
* retry\_time indicates the number of retries if the callback request fails
* sleep\_seconds indicates the time interval between each retry (unit: minutes)



You can configure multiple callback servers. The following output uses two callback servers as an example:

```
callback:
  cb_server:
    - service_address: http://callback-server-01:8080/v1/check
      pubkey_path: configs/callback-server-pub-01.key
    - service_address: http://callback-server-02:8080/v1/check
      pubkey_path: configs/callback-server-pub-02.key
  token_expire_minutes: 2
  retry_times: 60
  sleep_seconds: 60
```



## TSS Node & Callback Server Startup



Once the aforementioned configuration has been completed, you can start up the callback server and the TSS Node.&#x20;
