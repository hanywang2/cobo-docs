Cobo Custody offers RESTful APIs to allow users to access their crypto assets
or interact with blockchain applications on over 70 blockchains. The goal is to
make it easy for developers to build various kinds of blockchain applications,
such as cryptocurrency exchanges, token funds, payment platforms, asset-backed
lending platforms, DApps, mining pools, clould mining platforms and other
projects, by offloading the heavy-lift security and blockchain interaction
issues to Cobo's battle tested bank-grade technologies.

Developers may also store their digital assets with Cobo Custody, leveraging
Cobo's world-class hot warm and cold wallet architecture utilizing HSM

[Java](sdk/java), [PHP](sdk/php) for third-party developers to use, Currently

## Interface Change

Due to the rapid development of the blockchain itself and Cobo Custody's own
business, it is difficult for Cobo Custody to ensure that the existing returned
fields can fully meet the needs of customers, so Cobo will ensure **forward
compatibility** (the old fields cannot be deleted and the meaning will not
change), add a new field to the return value, Access parties need to be
compliant with this change.
