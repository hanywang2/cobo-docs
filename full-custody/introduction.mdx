Cobo Full Custody is built upon bank-grade security technologies such as
Hardware Security Modules (HSM) and Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), that
is battle tested in traditional financial industry. In comparison with [Cobo MPC
Custody](/mpc-custody/) and [Smart Contract Custody](/smart-contract-custody/),
Cobo Full Custody's clients entrust their private keys to Cobo, which are
stored in HSM and SGX based secure devices, and access their custodized assets
via web interface, mobile apps or SaaS APIs.

industry or enterprises who don't want to store and manage private keys by
themseves. It offers a wide range of features, such as all-in-one solutoin to
manage crypto assets across multiple blockchains and
[Wallet-as-a-Service](start-waas) API access etc.

are protected by bank-grade HSM, SGX, risk policies, and [Cobo
