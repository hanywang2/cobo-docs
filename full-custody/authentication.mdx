description: "WaaS API Authentication"

To securely access your crypto assets under Cobo Custody via APIs, Cobo
requires you to use ECDSA signature to authenticate yourself in all API calls.
After setting up a Cobo Custody account, you are able to generate and activate
a pair of public and private API keys. Refer to the [client libraries](sdk)
provided by Cobo for code samples.

You can get your Public API Key (Types: Query Only, Query&Withdraw) on Cobo
Custody's web interface. You should take a great care to store your credentials
and API Secret. Always keep remember that you should never give API Secret to
any untrusted person or application.

For enhanced API Key security, you SHOULD whitelist IP address while generating a new API Key.

Cobo API Key authentication requires each request to be signed except public API interfaces.

The data needs to be signed as the following:

```
HTTP_METHOD + |  +  HTTP_REQUEST_PATH + | + TIMESTAMP + | + PARAMS
```

The API signature should sign data with ECDSA signature after connection and sign the bytes with hex encoding.

<aside class="notice">
    Each component is defined as follows
</aside>

## HTTP HOST

- Sandbox : https://api.sandbox.cobo.com
- Develop: https://api.develop.cobo.com
- Production : https://api.custody.cobo.com

## HTTP_METHOD

Capitalized GET or POST. **Please note: Cobo doesn’t accept JSON payloads in HTTP POST. Please use form-data.**

## HTTP_REQUEST_PATH

The PATH part of the URL request. For example: /v1/test/
in [https://api.sandbox.cobo.com/v1/test/](https://api.sandbox.cobo.com/v1/test/).

## NONCE

The UNIX EPOCH timestamp when calling the API is in milliseconds.

## PARAMS

If the parameters are:

```
{
  "username": "username",
  "password": "password"
}
```

After sorting the key with alphabet:
`password=password`
`username=username`

Because "p" is sorted before "u" in the alphabet, "password" should be placed before "username" and then connected as
follows:
`password=password&username=username`

API parameters are key-value string pairs. Parameters need to be normalized before signing. The rule is as follows:

1. Sort parameters by keys alphabetically.
2. Transform each parameter to a string in the format of “key=value”.
3. Connect the strings with &.

## Example

For the following requests:

| Method | URL                                           | Nonce         |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| POST   | https://api.sandbox.cobo.com/v1/custody/test/ | 1537498830736 |

Paremeters

| Parameter | Value   |
| --------- | ------- |
| type      | limit   |
| side      | buy     |
| amount    | 100.0   |
| price     | 100.0   |
| symbol    | btcusdt |

Data to be prepared before signing are as follows:

```
POST|/v1/custody/test/|1537498830736|amount=100.0&price=100.0&side=buy&symbol=btcusdt&type=limit
```

Apply your locally generated API Secret to sign the data with ECDSA signature, and hex encode binary results to create
the final signature for API server verification. (See Cobo
examples: [https://github.com/CoboGlobal/](https://github.com/CoboGlobal/) )

HEADER FIELDS

- **BIZ-API-KEY**
  This field contains the API key.
- **BIZ-API-SIGNATURE**
  This field contains the signature.
- **BIZ-API-NONCE**
  This field contains the nonce.

Fill the Header with API Key, Nonce and signature on the right field to pass signature verification.

If you want to check Cobo pubkey to verify Cobo signature, please go to: Web management platform - Wallet - API
Callback. (NOTICE they're different in Sandbox&Prod environment)
