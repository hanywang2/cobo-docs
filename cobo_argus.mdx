# What is Cobo Argus?

Cobo Argus solves the limitations of existing multi-signature wallets and risk management by letting teams access DeFi protocols without sacrificing efficiency for security and providing advanced, proprietary financial risk-management tools. Through role-based access controls, asset owners can give specific access to operators for efficient, and controlled access and interaction with DeFi protocols. Asset owners will also be able to use risk-management tools for auto-deleveraging, liquidity management among different protocols, TVL change alerting, etc.

You could open the web app at [https://argus.cobo.com/](https://argus.cobo.com/). We recommend using Google Chrome.

## Cobo Argus Users

Cobo Argus users are DeFi participants that have large fund sizes and own a variety of different crypto assets, they typically access multiple protocols and have team members (eg: CIO, miners, traders, accountants, and admin operator) that will require various levels of access control. They are acutely aware of the lack of institutional-focused solutions in the market and might have tried developing their own systems of team collaboration and risk management role delegation and automatic alert systems. However, this is technically challenging and resource-heavy.

Two typical Argus users are crypto-native institutions (like DAOs), DeFi teams/liquidity providers for the smart contract-based Argus, and traditional finance firms like family offices, VCs, etc that typically require centralized DaaS solutions. For DAOs and DeFi teams/liquidity providers, they hold large amounts of crypto and require a liquidity management solution that brings good yield on the treasury while having good risk management tools such as multi-sig access and role-based delegation features. Traditional finance firms are eager to participate in the multi-billion dollar and exploding DeFi industry, however, they have no tools to reliably access DeFi protocols and the uncertainty and unknowns deter them from maximizing their DeFi potential.

As the industry matures, the need for dedicated blockchain DaaS solutions will grow - it will support the advanced needs of crypto native/visionary teams that require cross-chain access, role-based controls, and collaboration with multiple different DeFi protocols on different blockchains.

With the lack of collaboration tools to mitigate access control risks when interacting with DeFi protocols and the lack of custom workflow support, means that the onus of protecting and controlling the security of their crypto lies on just a few key people or a person in the organization. This person or small group will hold disproportionate amounts of responsibility and risk in ensuring the security of their crypto.

An example of how dangerous this is, in the case of QuadrigaCX CEO’s alleged death that took with him the passcodes that locked around US$250 million in customer assets. Another example is exchanges that lost funds due to a lack of internal risk controls due to staff misappropriation of funds, or carelessness/fraud of key persons. These problems can be mitigated through the removal of single points of failure, distributing risks through multi-sig approvals, delegated access controls, and multi-approval custom workflow engines with strict rules. We provide Argus as a solution in different environments, based on your organization’s needs.
