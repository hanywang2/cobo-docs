`Cobo Safe` is an [open-source](https://github.com/CoboGlobal/cobosafe) access control framework for smart contract wallets. Developed by Cobo, this framework allows the `Owner` of a smart contract wallet to delegate certain operations (e.g., transferring tokens, interacting with specific smart contracts, etc.) to the `Delegate`. The `Delegate` can then perform authorized wallet operations on behalf of the `Owner`.

The `Cobo Safe` framework includes the following components:

* **Cobo Account:** The smart contract wallet in a `Cobo Safe` framework.
* **Owner:** A privileged user who owners the smart contract wallet. The `Owner` can delegate `Permission` to other users in a `Cobo Safe` framework.
* **Delegate:** A user of least privilege in a `Cobo Safe` framework. The `Delegate` can perform certain wallet operations as authorized by the `Owner`.
* **Permission:** The authority to manage a `Cobo Account` in a `Cobo Safe` framework (i.e., initiating Ethereum transactions).
* **Role:** Each `Role` is associated with a set of `Permissions.`The `Owner` can pre-configure a set of `Permissions` for each `Role.`Then, the `Owner` can delegate a `Role` to the `Delegate` with the help of a `Role Manager`.
* **Role Manager:** A module that is used to manage each `Delegate` and its `Role.`Only the `Owner` is authorized to modify the settings of a `Role Manager.`In general, each `Cobo Account` will only have one `Role Manager`.
* **Authorizer:** A module that is used to review the `Permissions` granted to a `Delegate`. The `Authorizer` will check the transactions sent by the `Delegate` according to the configuration of the `Owner`. Unauthorized transactions will be rejected by the `Authorizer`.

By using `Authorizers`, `Cobo Safe` ensures a modular and easily customizable access control framework.

By leveraging `Cobo Safe`, Cobo Argus V2 effectively implements role-based access controls, enhancing transparency and flexibility in DeFi investments.
