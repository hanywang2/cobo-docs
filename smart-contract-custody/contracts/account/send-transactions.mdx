`Delegate` can call either `execTransaction()` or `execTransactions()` to send transactions.

The following uses `execTransaction()` as an example, where the `CallData` struct is passed in as a parameter.

```solidity
struct CallData {
    uint256 flag; // 0x1 delegate call, 0x0 call.
    address to;
    uint256 value;
    bytes data; // calldata
    bytes hint;
    bytes extra; // for future support: signatures etc.
}
```

Each field in the struct is defined as follows:

- **flag:** The call type. `0` indicates `call` and `1` indicates `delegatecall`. Note that the access controls associated with each type of call differs.
- **to**: The smart contract to be called.
- **value**: The transaction amount, denominated in ETH, when the contract is called.
- **data**: The `calldata` of the transaction. It is the `abi.encoded` parameters of the call.
- **hint**: When the `hint` field is set, the Authorizer will execute a fast path when verifying DeFi permissions, thus reducing gas fee consumption.

You can call `eth_call` without inputting the `hint` field. The `hint` field will then be returned in `TransactionResult` of the `execTransaction()` function.

The aforementioned process can be achieved using Cobo Safe SDKs. The following uses Cobo Safe SDKs in Javascript as an example.

```js
const { CoboSafeAccount } = require("./coboaccount.js");
const { ethers } = require("ethers");
const ERC20_ABI = require("./abi/ERC20.json");

require("dotenv").config();
const PRI_KEY = process.env.PRIV;
const COBO_SAFE_ADDRESS = process.env.COBOSAFE;

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("https://rpc.ankr.com/polygon");
const signer = new ethers.Wallet(PRI_KEY, provider);
const coboSafe = new CoboSafeAccount(COBO_SAFE_ADDRESS, signer);
const delegate = coboSafe.delegate;

const WMATIC_ADDRESS = "0x0d500b1d8e8ef31e21c99d1db9a6444d3adf1270";

async function main() {
  const token = new ethers.Contract(WMATIC_ADDRESS, ERC20_ABI, coboSafe);

  console.log(await token.balanceOf(await coboSafe.safe()));
  let tx = await token.transfer(delegate, 1);
  await tx.wait();
  console.log(await token.balanceOf(await coboSafe.safe()));
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```
